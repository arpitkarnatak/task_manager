# Task Manager

This is a task manager built using Python. I've used the following libraries:
### psutil
It is used to access system details and process utilities.

### tabulate
It is used to create tables.

### Working

1. For RAM Usage, press 1.
2. For currently active Processes, press 2. Enter a number N which is number of processes you want to display (it displays N highest memory processes)
3. For killing a process, press 3. Enter the process ID of the process you want to kill.
